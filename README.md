# Hydrodynamics and Cavitation Numerical Assignment

This report is part of the numerical assignment for the Hydrodynamics and Cavitation (151-0125-00L) course. The assignment
consists of three distinct problems, each addressing a classical hydrodynamics instability or nonlinear flow structure: the
capillary bridge, the viscous Burgers’ equation, and the Rayleigh–Plateau instability.
The first part investigates the capillary bridge formed between two circular loops. The numerical solution is used to analyze
the stability of the liquid bridge and the conditions under which a physically meaningful solution exists. Key relationships are
explored, including how the contact angle and neck radius vary with loop separation, and how a critical distance determines the
limit of stable bridge formation.
The second part addresses ...
The third part focuses on the Rayleigh–Plateau instability, which explains the breakup of a liquid jet into droplets due to surface
tension. The linear stability analysis is used to identify the most unstable wavenumber. Numerical plots are generated to
visualize the radial deformation of the jet and the pressure perturbation field within the liquid column at a given time.
Throughout the report, all problems are solved using Python and visualized to provide physical insight into the flow behaviors.
